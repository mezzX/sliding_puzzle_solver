# sliding_puzzle_solver
A sliding puzzle solver using the A* algorithm
# To do:
Write a proper README.md<br>
change the way the puzzle is shuffled so that the resulting board is always solvable<br>
implement some sort of "pause" in between input from the agent so that the moves are visible<br>
# Requirements
